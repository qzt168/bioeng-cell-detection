# Bioeng-Project: Image-Based Bioengineering Data Analysis and Query

> Note: This repo is about the first submission, which does not include YOLO models. For YOLO version, please refer to this link: https://github.com/qzt168/bio-cell-detection-yolo.

## Overvew

- The project developed an automated image analysis and query tool designed to convert unstructured biological cell image data into a structured tabular format and support natural language or SQL-like queries.
